			<h2>	<span STYLE="font-style: italic">Sea Otters </span></h3>
			<h3>Basic Information</h3>
			<p> The sea otter <mark>(Enhydra lutries) </mark> is a marine mammal native to the coasts of the northern and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Adults weigh around 31 and 99 lbs, making them the heaviest members of the weasel family. Sea otters are insulated by an exceptionally thick coat of fur, the densest in the animal kingdom. Each square inch of its fur has around one million hairs. Sea otters can walk on land, but they are also capable of living exclusively in the ocean.
			<h3>Diet</h3>
			<p> Sea otters can be quite picky eaters. For most, their diet consists almost entirely of marine invertebrates such as sea urchins, fat innkeeper worms, clams, mollusks, crustaceans, and snails. Other areas of otters eat fish almost exclusively. A study focusing on a sea otter population residing at Amchitka Island in the 1960's found that 50% of food in the sea otters' stomachs was fish.
			<h3>Endangerment</h3>
			<p> Sea otters are currently classified as an endangered species. Hundreds of years ago, the sea otter population was estimated to be 150,000-300,000. but after being hunted for their unique fur, the world population of sea otters fell to 1,000-2,000. Numbers are now on the rise due to the ban of hunting and other sea otter conservation hunters, although some areas have experienced recent declines in the population again.
